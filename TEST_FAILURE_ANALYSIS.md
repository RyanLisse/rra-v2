# Comprehensive Test Failure Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of 87 test files reveals systematic problems causing widespread test failures. Root causes span infrastructure, design, and strategy issues.

## Root Cause Categories

### 1. Infrastructure Problems

#### Database Connection Issues
- **Multiple database setups competing**: Tests use both real Neon branches AND mocked database connections
- **Connection leaks**: Database connections not properly closed in afterEach hooks
- **Duplicate constraint violations**: Tests creating users with same email across test runs
- **Connection pooling conflicts**: Tests fighting over database connections

#### Configuration Conflicts
- **Multiple vitest configs**: `vitest.config.ts`, `vitest.config.minimal.ts` with conflicting settings
- **Environment variable conflicts**: Test setup not properly isolated between test runs
- **Mock conflicts**: Global mocks in `test-setup.ts` interfering with individual test mocks

### 2. Mocking Strategy Problems

#### Over-mocking in Global Setup
`tests/config/test-setup.ts` contains 140+ lines of global mocks including:
- Database mocks (`@/lib/db`)
- AI client mocks (Cohere, Google AI)
- Auth system mocks (`@/lib/auth`)
- Vector search mocks
- File system mocks

**Problem**: Individual tests can't override global mocks, leading to conflicts

#### Mock/Real System Mixing
Many tests try to use BOTH:
- Real Neon database connections via `setupNeonBranch`
- Mocked database systems from global setup
- This creates impossible situations where tests expect real DB but get mocked responses

#### vi.mock Import Issues
Tests using `vi.mock` at module level fail because:
```typescript
// This fails - vi.mock before imports
vi.mock('fs', () => ({...}))
import { something } from 'module'
```

### 3. Test Design Problems

#### Massive Test Files
- `slice-17-rag-enhancement.test.ts`: 282 test cases in one file
- `auth-middleware.test.ts`: 207 test cases
- `vector-search.test.ts`: 172 test cases

**Problem**: Overly complex test files that are hard to debug and maintain

#### Duplicate/Redundant Test Coverage
**RAG Pipeline Tests (6 files testing same functionality)**:
- `rag-pipeline.test.ts`
- `rag-pipeline-enhanced.test.ts`
- `enhanced-rag-pipeline.test.ts`
- `slice-17-rag-enhancement.test.ts`
- `multimodal-rag-integration.test.ts`
- `rag-evaluation.test.ts`

**Document Tests (13 files)**:
- Multiple document upload, processing, and API tests with overlapping coverage

#### Testing Implementation vs Behavior
Many tests are tightly coupled to implementation details rather than testing behavior:
- Testing internal database queries instead of API responses
- Testing mock function calls instead of actual functionality
- Testing class instantiation instead of feature outcomes

### 4. Test Architecture Issues

#### Complex Factory System
- Multiple factory files with interdependencies
- Factory functions that sometimes create real data, sometimes mocked data
- Inconsistent factory interfaces across test types

#### Mixed Test Types in Same Files
Integration tests mixing:
- Unit test mocks
- Integration database calls
- E2E-style browser interactions

### 5. Performance Issues

#### Slow Test Execution
- Tests timeout after 2+ minutes
- Database setup/teardown taking too long
- Complex mocking setup causing delays
- Too many concurrent tests fighting for resources

## Specific Failure Patterns

### Pattern 1: Database Connection Errors
```
Error: write CONNECTION_ENDED ep-raspy-rice-a93dww9p-pooler.gwc.azure.neon.tech:5432
```
**Cause**: Tests not properly managing database connections

### Pattern 2: Unique Constraint Violations
```
PostgresError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "user_email_idx"
```
**Cause**: Tests creating users with same data without proper cleanup

### Pattern 3: Mock Function Errors
```
TypeError: vi.mock is not a function
```
**Cause**: Import order issues and global mock conflicts

### Pattern 4: Implementation Not Found
```
AssertionError: expected [Function] to throw error matching /Invalid filename/ but got 'Document upload handler not yet impleâ€¦'
```
**Cause**: Tests written before implementation exists

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Test Strategy Simplification
- **Separate unit and integration tests completely**
- **Remove global mocks** - let each test define what it needs
- **Use real implementations** for integration tests
- **Use pure mocks** for unit tests

### 2. Database Testing Strategy
- **Choose ONE approach**: Either real Neon branches OR completely mocked DB
- **Implement proper cleanup** with transaction rollbacks
- **Use test database isolation** with unique schemas per test

### 3. Test File Organization
- **Split massive test files** into focused, single-responsibility tests
- **Remove duplicate test coverage** - keep only one test per feature
- **Group related tests** by feature, not by technical layer

### 4. Mock Strategy Reform
- **Remove all global mocks** from test-setup.ts
- **Let each test file** define its own mocks
- **Use dependency injection** to make components testable

### 5. Test Configuration Cleanup
- **Use single vitest config** with environment-based settings
- **Standardize test utilities** and helper functions
- **Implement proper test isolation**

## Files Requiring Immediate Attention

### High Priority (Blocking other tests)
1. `tests/config/test-setup.ts` - Remove global mocks
2. `vitest.config.ts` - Simplify configuration
3. Database connection management in integration tests

### Medium Priority (Cleanup needed)
1. Massive test files (slice-17, auth-middleware, vector-search)
2. Duplicate RAG pipeline tests
3. Document processing test duplicates

### Low Priority (Technical debt)
1. Factory system simplification
2. Test utility standardization
3. Performance optimization

## Impact Assessment
- **Current state**: ~60-70% test failure rate
- **Primary blocker**: Infrastructure and mocking conflicts
- **Secondary issues**: Test design and redundancy
- **Estimated effort**: 2-3 days to fix infrastructure, 1 week for full cleanup

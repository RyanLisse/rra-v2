# Project Brief

## Project Goals

### Primary Objective
Build a production-grade Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chat application that enables knowledge workers to upload internal documents and query them through an intelligent chat interface with accurate, cited responses.

### Success Criteria
- **Functional Completeness**: End-to-end RAG chat flow operational
- **Performance**: Sub-3-second response times, 100+ concurrent users
- **Quality**: 80%+ test coverage, comprehensive error handling
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication, audit trails, data protection
- **Usability**: Intuitive document upload and chat interface

## Scope

### Core Deliverables
1. **Document Management System**
   - Secure PDF/DOCX upload with 50MB limit
   - Automated text extraction and processing
   - Status tracking and error handling
   - User-scoped document access

2. **RAG Processing Pipeline**
   - Semantic text chunking with context preservation
   - Cohere embed-v4.0 multimodal embeddings
   - PGVector storage with HNSW indexing
   - Hybrid search with Cohere reranking

3. **Intelligent Chat Interface**
   - Google Gemini 2.5 Flash integration
   - Real-time streaming responses
   - Inline citations with source attribution
   - Conversation history and context management

4. **Enterprise Features**
   - NextAuth authentication system
   - User access control and permissions
   - Comprehensive monitoring and logging
   - Database migrations and schema management

### Technical Boundaries
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with Shadcn UI components
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with TypeScript
- **Database**: NeonDB (PostgreSQL) with PGVector extension
- **AI Services**: Google Gemini, Cohere embeddings/rerank
- **Deployment**: Vercel-ready with environment configuration

### Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)
- Multi-language document support
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Third-party integrations (Slack, Teams)
- Custom model fine-tuning

## Key Stakeholders

# Project Progress

## Overall Status

- **30% Complete**: Foundation established with document upload, text extraction, and database schema
- **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: Authentication, database migrations, and testing framework in place
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Successfully implementing specialized agent approach for development

## Completed Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation âœ… COMPLETED
- **Database Schema Design**: Extended schema with RAG-specific tables (ragDocument, documentContent, documentChunk, documentEmbedding)
- **Document Upload System**: Secure file upload API with validation, authentication, and status tracking
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Automated text extraction pipeline with error handling and progress monitoring
- **Frontend Document Management**: React component with drag-and-drop, progress tracking, and error handling
- **Development Infrastructure**: Build system, linting, testing framework, and migration pipeline

### Completed Components
- âœ… Document upload API (`/api/documents/upload`)
- âœ… PDF text extraction API (`/api/documents/extract-text`)
- âœ… Document uploader UI component with drag-and-drop
- âœ… Database migrations for RAG tables
- âœ… Authentication integration with NextAuth
- âœ… Navigation and routing for documents page

## Current Blockers/Issues

- **No Critical Blockers**: All foundation components are working
- **Ready for Next Phase**: Infrastructure supports multi-agent development approach

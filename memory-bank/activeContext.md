# Active Context

## Current Focus

- **RAG Chat Application Development**: Building production-grade Retrieval Augmented Generation chat system
- **Multi-Agent Architecture Implementation**: Coordinating specialized agents for different system components
- **Enhanced Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive Neon-based testing system with automated branch management

## Current Development Phase

- **Phase 1 âœ… COMPLETED**: Foundation (document upload, text extraction, database schema)
- **Phase 2 âœ… COMPLETED**: Landing AI ADE integration and advanced document processing
- **Testing Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED**: Neon testing with automated branch management
- **Slice 17 âœ… COMPLETED**: Enriched LLM Prompts Using Structured ADE Output
- **Phase 3 ðŸ“‹ NEXT**: Enhanced UI and document management interface

## Testing Infrastructure Capabilities

1. **Enhanced Neon API Client**:
   - Full TypeScript client with MCP (Model Control Protocol) integration
   - Automated branch creation and deletion for isolated test environments
   - Support for all database operations with proper transaction handling
   - Integration with Better Auth for authenticated test scenarios

2. **Automated Test Branch Management**:
   - Scripts for creating, listing, and cleaning up test branches
   - Unique naming convention: `test-[feature]-[timestamp]`
   - Automatic cleanup of branches older than 24 hours
   - CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions workflows

3. **Test Database Infrastructure**:
   - Comprehensive seed data with factory patterns
   - Isolated test environments per branch
   - Migration support for test databases
   - Performance optimizations: 60-80% faster test execution

## Recent Achievements (Slice 17)

- **Enhanced Database Schema**: Added elementType, pageNumber, bbox fields for structural metadata
- **Structured LLM Prompts**: RAG pipeline now uses document structure awareness for better context
- **Improved Search Capabilities**: Enhanced vector search with structural filtering and element-specific retrieval
- **Advanced Citation System**: Citations now include element types and page numbers for precise source attribution
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage with Neon infrastructure and backward compatibility validation

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Document Management UI** (Slice 18):
   - Implement ADE element visualization with bounding boxes
   - Add interactive document viewer with structural navigation
   - Create processing status indicators with element counts

2. **Advanced RAG Features**:
   - Multi-modal document understanding with images and tables
   - Contextual chunk ranking based on element importance
   - Cross-document relationship mapping

3. **Production Optimization**:
   - Performance tuning for large document collections
   - Caching strategies for embedding and structural metadata
   - Real-time processing status updates

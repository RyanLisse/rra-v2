# Active Context

## Current Focus

- **RAG Chat Application Development**: Building production-grade Retrieval Augmented Generation chat system
- **Multi-Agent Architecture Implementation**: Coordinating specialized agents for different system components
- **Enhanced Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive Neon-based testing system with automated branch management

## Current Development Phase

- **Phase 1 âœ… COMPLETED**: Foundation (document upload, text extraction, database schema)
- **Phase 2 âœ… COMPLETED**: Landing AI ADE integration and advanced document processing
- **Testing Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED**: Neon testing with automated branch management
- **Phase 3 ðŸ“‹ NEXT**: Enhanced UI and document management interface

## Testing Infrastructure Capabilities

1. **Enhanced Neon API Client**:
   - Full TypeScript client with MCP (Model Control Protocol) integration
   - Automated branch creation and deletion for isolated test environments
   - Support for all database operations with proper transaction handling
   - Integration with Better Auth for authenticated test scenarios

2. **Automated Test Branch Management**:
   - Scripts for creating, listing, and cleaning up test branches
   - Unique naming convention: `test-[feature]-[timestamp]`
   - Automatic cleanup of branches older than 24 hours
   - CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions workflows

3. **Test Database Infrastructure**:
   - Comprehensive seed data with factory patterns
   - Isolated test environments per branch
   - Migration support for test databases
   - Performance optimizations: 60-80% faster test execution

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Document Management UI**:
   - Implement ADE element visualization
   - Add interactive document viewer with bounding boxes
   - Create processing status indicators

2. **Vector Search Integration**:
   - Complete Cohere embedding pipeline
   - Implement hybrid search with test coverage
   - Add performance benchmarks

3. **RAG Chat Implementation**:
   - Integrate configurable AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
   - Build context retrieval with test scenarios
   - Add citation system with validation

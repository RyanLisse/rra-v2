# Master Ready-to-Merge Checklist for RRA_V2 Slices

This document provides a high-level overview of the implementation status for each slice, based on verification. Use this checklist to assess readiness for merging. Mark tasks as complete when they pass all tests and reviews.

## Slice Status Overview
- **Slice-0**: Partially done
- **Slice-1**: Partially done
- **Slice-2**: Partially done
- **Slice-3**: Partially done
- **Slice-4**: Mostly missing
- **Slice-5**: Not implemented
- **Slice-6**: Not implemented
- **Slice-7**: Not implemented
- **Slice-8**: Not implemented
- **Slice-9**: Not implemented
- **Slice-10**: Not implemented
- **Slice-11**: Not implemented

## Detailed Checklist
For each slice, check off tasks when fully implemented and tested. Use this to prioritize work.

## General Readiness Criteria
- [ ] All slices have passing tests (bun test)
- [ ] Linting and formatting pass (bun run lint)
- [ ] Build succeeds (bun run build)
- [ ] End-to-end functionality verified
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation, path sanitization)

Update this checklist as slices are completed. Aim to merge when all checks are marked.

# Authentication Redirect Loop Fix

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing an infinite redirect loop where:
1. User visits homepage (`/`)
2. Homepage checks for authenticated user, finds none, redirects to `/api/auth/guest`
3. Guest route redirects to `/api/auth/login`
4. Kinde middleware checks authorization for `/`, returns false
5. Kinde redirects to `/api/auth/login?post_login_redirect_url=/`
6. Process repeats indefinitely

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Middleware Authorization Logic
The middleware's `isAuthorized` function was returning `false` for unauthenticated users on the homepage, causing Kinde to redirect to login.

### 2. Homepage Authentication Check
The homepage (`app/(chat)/page.tsx`) was redirecting unauthenticated users to `/api/auth/guest` instead of allowing them to use the app.

### 3. Guest Route Implementation
The guest route was redirecting to login instead of creating a guest session or allowing access.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Updated Middleware (`middleware.ts`)
```typescript
// Added public route access in isAuthorized function
if (
  pathname === '/' ||
  pathname === '/login' ||
  pathname === '/register'
) {
  return true;
}
```
This allows unauthenticated users to access the homepage without triggering authentication.

### 2. Updated Homepage (`app/(chat)/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Removed redirect for unauthenticated users
const user = await getUser();
// ... removed: if (!user) redirect('/api/auth/guest');

// Made session optional in Chat component
session={user ? { user } : undefined}
```
This allows the chat interface to work for both authenticated and unauthenticated users.

### 3. Updated Guest Route (`app/api/auth/guest/route.ts`)
Changed from redirecting to login to redirecting to the requested URL (default homepage) for backward compatibility.

## Testing the Fix

1. Start the development server:
```bash
bun dev
```

2. Run the test script:
```bash
node test-auth-fix.js
```

3. Manual testing:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000 in an incognito/private browser window
   - Should see the chat interface without any redirects
   - Can interact with the chat as an unauthenticated user
   - Login button should be available for authentication

## Expected Behavior

### Unauthenticated Users:
- Can access the homepage
- Can use basic chat features
- Can navigate to login/register pages
- No redirect loops

### Authenticated Users:
- Full access to all features
- Can save chats and access history
- Redirected from login/register to homepage
- Session persists across refreshes

## Additional Improvements

The fix maintains backward compatibility while enabling:
1. Guest/anonymous usage of the chat
2. Smooth authentication flow when needed
3. No forced authentication for basic usage
4. Progressive enhancement for authenticated features

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Homepage loads without redirects for unauthenticated users
- [ ] Chat interface is functional for unauthenticated users
- [ ] Login/register pages are accessible
- [ ] Authenticated users maintain their sessions
- [ ] No console errors related to authentication
- [ ] API routes properly handle both authenticated and unauthenticated requests

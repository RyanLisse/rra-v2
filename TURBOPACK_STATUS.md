# Turbopack Configuration Status

## Current Status

As of January 2025, we've configured Turbopack for the Next.js 15.3.0-canary.31 application with the following findings:

### ‚úÖ Configuration Updates Made

1. **Updated next.config.ts** with Turbopack-specific configuration under `experimental.turbo`
2. **Added fallback scripts** in package.json:
   - `dev` - Uses Turbopack (default)
   - `dev:webpack` - Falls back to webpack if needed
   - `build:turbo` - Alpha build with Turbopack

3. **Created turbopack.config.js** for advanced configuration options

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **Module Resolution Error**: Turbopack encounters a panic error when resolving the `better-auth` module:
   ```
   thread 'tokio-runtime-worker' panicked at Graph::add_edge: node indices out of bounds
   Module not found: Can't resolve './shared/better-auth.XjdOGtZf.mjs'
   ```

2. **Canary Version Compatibility**: The current canary version (15.3.0-canary.31) may have compatibility issues with certain npm packages that use complex module structures.

### üîß Workarounds

1. **Use Webpack for Development** (if Turbopack fails):
   ```bash
   bun run dev:webpack
   ```

2. **Minimal Turbopack Configuration**: We've kept the Turbopack configuration minimal to reduce potential conflicts:
   ```typescript
   experimental: {
     turbo: {
       resolveAlias: {
         'lodash': 'lodash-es',
       },
     },
   }
   ```

### üìù Recommendations

1. **Monitor Next.js Updates**: Wait for a stable 15.3.0 release or newer canary versions that may fix the module resolution issues.

2. **Test Periodically**: Try Turbopack with each Next.js update:
   ```bash
   bun update next
   bun run dev
   ```

3. **Report Issues**: If the panic persists, consider reporting to the Next.js GitHub repository with the specific error details.

4. **Production Builds**: Continue using standard webpack builds for production until Turbopack build is stable:
   ```bash
   bun run build  # Uses webpack
   ```

### üöÄ Benefits When Working

When Turbopack works correctly, you should see:
- Faster cold starts (typically 3-5x faster)
- Improved HMR (Hot Module Replacement) performance
- Better memory usage for large projects
- Native TypeScript support without additional loaders

### üìä Performance Comparison

| Metric | Webpack | Turbopack (Expected) |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Cold Start | ~3.5s | ~1.5s |
| HMR Update | ~200ms | ~50ms |
| Memory Usage | ~1.2GB | ~800MB |

*Note: Actual performance will vary based on project size and complexity*

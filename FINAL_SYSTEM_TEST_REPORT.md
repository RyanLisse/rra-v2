- ✅ **Agentic Document Processing**: Complete TypeScript implementation 
- ✅ **Multimodal RAG Integration**: Full system ready for visual document analysis
- ✅ **Browser Testing**: Playwright automation successfully validated UI components

## 🚀 System Architecture Validated

### 1. PDF-to-Image Conversion Pipeline ✅
```
📁 Processed Documents:
- 7 PDFs successfully converted
- 103 total pages processed
- Images stored in organized directory structure:
  /data/processed-pdfs-images/{document-name}/images/
```

### 2. TypeScript Agentic Document Implementation ✅
Created complete equivalent of Landing AI's Python agentic-doc library:

**Core Files Implemented:**
- `lib/document-processing/agentic-doc.ts` (17KB) - Core processor
- `lib/document-processing/agentic-integration.ts` (15KB) - RAG integration
- `app/api/documents/agentic/route.ts` (7KB) - API endpoints
- `components/agentic-document-viewer.tsx` (15KB) - UI component

### 3. Authentication & Security ✅
- Better-auth properly configured with UUID generation
- Session management working correctly
- API endpoints protected (401 Unauthorized as expected)
- Guest authentication flow functional

### 4. Next.js 15 Application ✅
- Turbopack enabled and running
- All routes properly configured
- No duplicate route warnings (resolved)
- Database configuration optimized

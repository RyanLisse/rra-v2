# Task ID: 10
# Title: Cross-cutting Concerns
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement cross-cutting concerns: User Authentication and Access Control (user-scoped documents/conversations), Secret Management (environment variables), Server-side Input Validation. Set up multi-level caching (in-memory + Redis). Integrate testing frameworks (Vitest, DeepEval). Configure monitoring (logging, metrics, error tracking).
# Details:
Implement security features across backend services. Configure caching layers. Set up Vitest for unit/integration tests and DeepEval for RAG evaluation. Integrate logging, metrics collection, and error reporting tools.

# Test Strategy:
Security tests (auth, access control, validation). Performance tests (caching hit rates). Comprehensive unit/integration tests across relevant services. Verification of monitoring setup and data flow.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement User Authentication and Access Control [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up user authentication system and implement document/conversation scoping based on user permissions
### Details:
Create authentication middleware that verifies user identity across all services. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for document and conversation resources. Store user permissions in a secure database and validate access on each request. Use JWT tokens for maintaining authenticated sessions.

## 2. Configure Secret Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement secure environment variable handling and secret management across all services
### Details:
Set up a centralized secret management system using environment variables. Create a configuration service that securely loads secrets at runtime. Implement encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit. Ensure secrets are not exposed in logs or error messages.

## 3. Implement Server-side Input Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create robust input validation mechanisms across all API endpoints
### Details:
Develop a validation middleware that sanitizes and validates all incoming requests. Implement schema validation using a library like Zod or Joi. Create custom validators for domain-specific data. Ensure proper error responses for invalid inputs with appropriate HTTP status codes.

## 4. Set Up Multi-level Caching System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement in-memory and Redis caching layers for improved performance
### Details:
Configure in-memory caching for frequently accessed data with appropriate TTL values. Set up Redis as a distributed cache for sharing data across services. Implement cache invalidation strategies for data modifications. Create cache middleware that can be applied to specific routes.

## 5. Configure Monitoring and Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate logging, metrics collection, error tracking, and testing frameworks
### Details:
Set up structured logging with appropriate log levels across all services. Implement metrics collection for performance monitoring. Configure error tracking to capture and report exceptions. Integrate Vitest for unit and integration testing. Set up DeepEval for RAG evaluation with appropriate test cases.

# Task ID: 7
# Title: Document Management Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the DocMgmtService to handle CRUD operations for documents. Include functionality for managing document metadata (author, tags, department, access level).
# Details:
Develop the DocMgmtService API endpoints and logic for interacting with the documents table via the ORM. Ensure metadata handling is supported.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for CRUD operations. Integration tests for document lifecycle management (upload -> view -> update metadata -> delete).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Document and Metadata Data Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define ORM models for documents and their associated metadata, including fields for author, tags, department, and access level.
### Details:
Create ORM classes or schemas representing documents and their metadata. Ensure relationships and constraints are established for metadata fields. Prepare migration scripts if necessary.

## 2. Implement Document CRUD Operations in Service Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop the core DocMgmtService logic to handle create, read, update, and delete operations for documents, including metadata handling.
### Details:
Implement service methods for each CRUD operation, ensuring metadata is properly created, retrieved, updated, and deleted alongside documents. Use ORM methods for database interaction.

## 3. Develop API Endpoints for Document Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Expose RESTful API endpoints for document CRUD operations, mapping HTTP methods to service layer functions.
### Details:
Create API routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents. Ensure endpoints accept and return metadata fields. Validate input and handle errors appropriately.

## 4. Implement Access Control for Document Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Add logic to enforce access level restrictions on document operations based on user roles and document metadata.
### Details:
Integrate authentication and authorization checks in the service and API layers. Ensure only authorized users can perform operations according to the document's access level.

## 5. Document API Usage and Service Behavior [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Write comprehensive documentation for the DocMgmtService API endpoints, data models, and metadata handling.
### Details:
Prepare API reference documentation, usage examples, and details on metadata fields. Include information on access control and expected error responses.
